# Final-Project

Project 3 : Regression Problem 1
In this problem, the task is to predict the current health (as given by the target variable) of an organism
given the measurements from two biological sensors measuring their bio-markers (negative indicates
that it is lesser than the average case). With this data, you are expected to try our linear regression
models on the training data and report the following metrics on the test split: (a) Mean Squared Error,
(b) Mean Absolute Error.
